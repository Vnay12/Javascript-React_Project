            ReactDom.createRoot

1) createRoot creates it own DOM like structure and which is same to browser DOM ( browser has its own DOM )

2) its compares the main Dom and virtual DOM and only updates those which has changed 

on the other hand 

web broswer completely repaste the whole DOM thats why there is loading when we change something also called reload

3) question : A) what if your component is dependant on some network or API and there is requets of change in the componenet one after another ? 

B) what if is there any way to drop those request and only update the priority one and the latest one ? 

-----> Hence react fiber is used as a algorithm to control the virtual DOM 

NOTE : virtual dom is still in use ( not that much) but react fiber is the algorthm behind the virtual dom 


4) what is reconciliation ? 

-->> The algorithm React uses to differentiate one tree with another to determine which part to be changed.
 web browser Dom and react tree DOM 

 Reconciliation is what called virtual DOM 


 Note : Now fiber is used inplace of reconciliation for virtual DOM 
 
 In a UI, it's not necessary for every date to applied immediately; in fact, can be wasteful, causing frames to and degrading the user experience.

 pros : 
1) pause work and come back to it later
2) assign priority to different types of work
3) reuse previously completed work.
4) abort work if it's no longer needed.
