#  Creating own react library and understanding how react works indepth 

                03_customreact 



we have to create a custoom react as in how react reads all the functional or object component passed as html tag in return statment 

1) we created 1 index html and set the page -> root
2) we read the root in " react.js " file 
3) we created a object how react creats an object of the html tag as branch 
4) we created 2 function to render that object as react has its own reactdom.render 

-- this is how react works under the hood, basically indepth explanation of reactdom.render --
